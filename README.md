## Terms

>**To bikeshed or Bikeshedding:** Arguments that are irrelevant to the > program. Unnecessary work.

>**Yakshaving:** all the work that is not the core of what you are trying to solve, but you still have to do it to get to the point. Necessary but not the main work.

>**Boilerplate:** All the paperwork or set of files you need for a project. Use tools like Create React App to get the Boilerplate and start a React Project. Files like red-meats and json are part of the boilerplate for a project.

>**Scaffolding:** Set of files or functions you bring up at the beginning, so you can get going and that you replace as you build more complex versions of those files.

>**Onboarding:** When you bring a new employee onboard the team. It’s the series of steps you take to help them get started with the code base, tools they need to use, and understanding the system before they can contribute.

>**Dogfooding:** (eating your own dog food). If the tool you’re working in, say a project management tool, is being used as part of the process of building that tool, then you’re doing dogfooding. Test your products in real-world usage using product management techniques. Hence dogfooding can act as quality control, and eventually a kind of testimonial advertising.

>**Rubberducking:** Reference to Sesame Street when Ernie is taking a bath and has a dog in his hand, and he is telling him all his problems. When you have a problem you don’t know how to solve you ask a coworker or friend to come and start telling them all the details of your problem and as you do that is claims clear in your head and you figure out the solution, sometimes before you finish explaining the problem.

>**Green field:** When you start a project with nothing before it, you’re starting on a nice green field of pure grass. There’s nothing else there you have to deal with and you can focus on the problem and you solution you want to build.

>**Brown field:** Contrary to the green field, you have to deal with an existing system, you have to fix all the problems it already has, it slows you down, you have to deal with what the users already expect. That’s of the known as Technical debt, which is when past developers of the system took some shortcuts and made some decisions that you’re paying the price now.
